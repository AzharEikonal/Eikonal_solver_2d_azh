We solve the Eikonal equation on triangular meshes of 2D flat domains and 3D surfaces. It is a C++ implementation of meshFIM algorithm, which solves the Eikonal equation (non-linear PDE) for the unsigned distance function on the CPU and on parallel architectures like GPUs. I have implemented this algorithm to solve the Eikonal equation on the CPU. I have written every solver in C++ from the scratch and limited the use of libraries to shorten the execution time. I have tested my code on a diverse set of meshes, including 3D surface meshes. 
I have also included many 3D surface examples like arm, bunny, cone, cube, cylinder, sphere, torus and wedge, and 2D flat domain examples like blob1, blob2, blob5, circle, hand, rabbit and triangle. Every example folder contains three images showing the visual representations of calculated values, actual values, and errors as color maps over the mesh, and it also contains .vtk files, which can be opened in the Paraview software to render the meshes and see values as color map over the mesh. 
The main code is in main.cpp, and we calculate the actual values for 2D flat domains in true_dist.cpp. True values for unsigned distance fields for 3D surface meshes are calculated using the libel library via the geodesic function. We are writing a vtk file in writevtk.cpp for visual representations of calculated values and errors in software like Paraview.
